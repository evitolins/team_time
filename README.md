=======================================
![screenshot](screenshot_1.png)
A simple tool for finding best meeting times for distributed teams.


Details
---------------------------------------
Allows custom settings for availability and a clear view of what times work
best for the majority of the team distributed across many timezones.

In the future, it would be great to integrate this into existing apps/services
which deal with teams and already posess timezone & scheduling data.



Todo
---------------------------------------
- [ ] Add user-specific availablity
- [ ] Add user filtering
- [ ] Add groups feature to quickly filter specific users
- [ ] Consider service integrations
    - [ ] Slack user info (name, timezone, avatar...etc)
    - [ ] Google On Air
    - [ ] Google Calendar
    - [ ] Asana Tickets
    - [ ] Build Doodle
- [ ] Add "sacrifice counter" for each individual. This would be used for balancing extreme meeting times for any one user.
